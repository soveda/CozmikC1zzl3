# C1ZZL3 Web MIDI SysEx Protocol

This protocol is implemented by the production C1ZZL3 firmware.

## Transport

- USB MIDI device mode when connected to a computer/DAW/browser.
- USB MIDI host mode at boot on 2025 hardware when the port is downstream-facing
  and a class-compliant USB MIDI controller is attached.
- Browser/editor sends Web MIDI SysEx to the card in USB MIDI device mode.
- Factory presets `0..8` are never overwritten by SysEx.
- Custom slots are enumerated after the factory presets as card presets `9..16`.
- Custom envelopes with no non-zero amplitude stage are rejected.

## Frame

All bytes inside the SysEx frame are 7-bit clean.

```text
F0 7D 43 31 5A 33 cc payload... F7
```

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `F0` | SysEx start |
| `7D` | non-commercial/manufacturer development ID |
| `43 31 5A 33` | C1ZZL3 card ID, ASCII `C1Z3` |
| `cc` | command byte |
| `payload...` | command payload |
| `F7` | SysEx end |

## Commands

| Command | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `01` | Load custom envelope into RAM |
| `02` | Save custom envelope to flash |
| `03` | Apply ring/noise/MIDI channel settings |
| `04` | Reserved settings-save command; currently applies settings like `03` |

## Envelope Payload

Envelope commands `01` and `02` use a 97-byte payload:

```text
1 custom slot target
16 name bytes
40 amplitude stage bytes
40 phase-distortion stage bytes
```

The name bytes are accepted for frame compatibility, but the firmware stores
shape data only. Names remain in browser local storage.

The firmware expects 103 bytes between `F0` and `F7`:

```text
1 manufacturer byte
4 card ID bytes
1 command byte
97 payload bytes
```

## Stage Encoding

Each envelope lane has exactly eight stages. Each stage is encoded as:

```text
level_lsb7 level_msb7 time_lsb7 time_mid7 time_msb7
```

`level` is a 14-bit little-endian 7-bit packed integer:

```text
level = level_lsb7 | (level_msb7 << 7)
```

Valid firmware range:

```text
0..4095
```

`time` is a 21-bit little-endian 7-bit packed integer:

```text
time = time_lsb7 | (time_mid7 << 7) | (time_msb7 << 14)
```

Firmware treats `time == 0` as `1` sample and caps very long stages internally.

## Performance Settings Payload

Settings commands `03` and `04` use a 5-byte payload:

```text
rr rr nn nn ic
```

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rr rr` | ring modulation amount, 14-bit packed, `0..4095` |
| `nn nn` | noise amount, 14-bit packed, `0..4095` |
| `ic` | MIDI input channel encoded as `0..15` for channels `1..16` |

There is no MIDI acknowledgement frame.

## Current Limitations

- No SysEx readback.
- Custom slot names are kept by the browser editor, not by the card firmware.
- Silent custom envelopes are not accepted.
- USB role is selected only at boot/reset.
- Web MIDI SysEx editing is only available in USB MIDI device mode.
- Turing MIDI output is intentionally absent for stability.
- The Turing clock does not continue running in synth mode; CV and pulse outputs
  hold the last Turing values.
