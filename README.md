# C1ZZL3

Dual phase-distortion synthesiser and probabilistic Turing machine program card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

Status: Hardware-tested v1  
Language: C++ / Pico SDK  
Framework: ComputerCard  
Creator: Adrian Vos

## Overview

C1ZZL3 is a CZ-inspired phase-distortion oscillator card with a second mirrored oscillator for detune, ring modulation, and noise modulation. The switch also opens a Turing machine mode, turning the card into a clocked CV and pulse source with a self-playing stepped oscillator voice.

The current v1 build has passed hardware tests for the core oscillator, held-switch performance controls, Turing machine outputs, self-playing stepped Turing voice, oscillator sync, restrained CZ-style grit, envelope presets, manual flash persistence, and 1V/oct pitch input scaling.

Holding the switch down during startup enters envelope preset select. Release the startup hold, then Main chooses one of nine presets, LEDs show the preset number in binary, a short down press exits for the current session, and a long down hold saves the selected preset to flash.

## Current Modes

### Switch Middle: PD Synth

Main controls oscillator pitch over an octave-based range. Audio/CV in 1 adds pitch at a hardware-tested 1V/oct scale.

X controls phase-distortion amount. Fully counter-clockwise is closest to a clean sine. Turning X up introduces the selected CZ-style target waveform.

Y morphs across eight CZ-inspired waveform families:

1. Saw
2. Square
3. Needle pulse
4. Double sine
5. Saw-pulse curve
6. Resonance I, saw window
7. Resonance II, triangle window
8. Resonance III, trapezoid window

Audio out 1 carries oscillator 1.

Audio out 2 carries oscillator 2. In normal middle position, oscillator 2 is silent until it has been introduced with the held-switch controls.

CV out 1 and CV out 2 continue to carry the scaled Turing machine CV signals, so the sequencer can modulate other modules while the synth voice is playing.

Pulse out 1 carries the main Turing pulse. Pulse out 2 carries an alternate Turing bit pulse.

### Hold Switch Down: Performance Edit

Holding the switch down edits the latched second oscillator and modulation amounts. The normal Main, X, and Y synth controls are held at their last middle-position values while editing, and the held controls must move after the switch is pressed before soft pickup can edit a latched value.

Main controls oscillator 2 detune and level from the centre point. Around 12 o'clock, oscillator 2 is off. Turning left detunes down; turning right detunes up. The further from centre, the louder oscillator 2 becomes.

X controls ring modulation amount. The setting remains active after the switch is released.

Y controls noise modulation amount. The setting remains active after the switch is released.

Oscillator 2 mirrors oscillator 1's phase-distortion shape and selected waveform family.

Holding the switch down from middle synth mode for 8 seconds saves the current latched detune, ring, and noise settings to flash. Saved settings load automatically on startup. There is no autosave.

Pulse in 2 triggers the selected envelope preset as well as softened oscillator sync. Preset 0 is Off and ignores Pulse in 2, so the synth remains free-running. Active envelope presets gate the oscillator output, so the synth is silent between triggers.

### Switch Up: Turing Machine

Main controls mutation/lock behaviour. The centre is most random. The extremes become more locked.

X controls sequence length, from 2 to 16 steps.

Y controls internal clock speed.

Pulse in 1 acts as an external clock. When an external clock is present, it takes priority over the internal clock.

Flicking the switch down from Turing mode taps the internal clock tempo.

CV out 1 carries the scaled stepped Turing CV.

CV out 2 carries a smoothed version of the scaled Turing CV.

Pulse out 1 outputs the main Turing pulse. Pulse out 2 outputs an alternate Turing bit pulse.

Audio out 1 and audio out 2 carry a self-playing stepped oscillator voice. The last PD synth pitch, phase-distortion, waveform, detune, ring, and noise settings are used as the voice sound, with the Turing pattern added to the pitch.

When an envelope preset is active, the main Turing pulse self-triggers the envelope for the stepped oscillator voice. Preset 0 is Off and leaves the Turing voice free-running. Turing envelope triggers do not reset oscillator phase.

## Inputs And Outputs

## Build

This project uses the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK and the ComputerCard header-only framework.

The current `CMakeLists.txt` includes Workshop Computer build settings:

- `PICO_XOSC_STARTUP_DELAY_MULTIPLIER=64`
- USB stdio disabled
- `copy_to_ram` binary type
- warning flags for accidental floating-point promotion
- linker memory usage output

Offline verification build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-verify -DPICO_NO_PICOTOOL=1
cmake --build build-verify
```

Normal UF2 output requires `picotool` to be installed or available to the Pico SDK.

## Current Hardware Notes

Confirmed on hardware:

- Oscillator output is audible and clean.
- Main pitch control uses an octave-based range.
- Audio/CV in 1 tracks at 1V/oct using the Workshop Computer 12V-over-4096-count input convention used by Chord Blimey.
- X phase-distortion control and Y waveform morphing are responsive across the usable range.
- All eight waveform positions have distinct character, including the CZ-style resonance-window shapes at positions 6-8.
- Held-switch soft pickup, latched detune/ring/noise controls, and 8-second manual save work as intended.
- Envelope preset select, binary LED display, triggering, and persistence work as intended.
- Turing mode clocks correctly from internal clock, tap tempo, and Pulse in 1.
- Turing CV/pulse outputs, self-playing stepped voice, and envelope self-triggering work as intended.

Recently tuned:

- Pitch now uses an octave-based frequency map, with Audio/CV in 1 scaled from the Workshop Computer 12V-over-4096-count input convention used by Chord Blimey.
- X has a gentler response curve for more usable low-to-mid settings.
- Y waveform morphing now uses a direct waveform target, with CZ-style saw, square, pulse, double sine, saw-pulse curve, and three distinct resonance-window positions.
- Held-switch Y now adds restrained sample-held CZ-style grit by gently jittering phase distortion and oscillator phase instead of crossfading in plain audio noise.
- Turing internal clock range uses a faster curved response for a more useful minimum and middle setting.
- Turing CV outputs are scaled to three-quarter range with a slight upward bias for pitch-friendly modulation depth.
- Turing mode audio outs now carry a self-playing stepped oscillator voice using the last PD synth sound.
- Active envelope presets can be self-triggered by the main Turing pulse without oscillator sync.
- Ring modulation now uses a stronger internal carrier while keeping some dry signal at the maximum setting to avoid full signal loss.
- Held-switch performance controls now require movement before soft pickup, and Main/X/Y no longer change pitch, PD amount, or waveform while editing detune/ring/noise.
- Manual flash persistence saves latched performance settings after an 8-second held-switch gesture; autosave is intentionally avoided.
- Brass envelope decay has been lengthened, oscillator sync now uses a very short fade, and preset 0 ignores Pulse in 2 for clean free-running oscillator use.
- Envelope presets are ordered by musical family: short percussive shapes, tonal/instrument-like shapes, then unusual/special shapes.
- Reordering envelope presets changes the meaning of saved preset numbers; re-save the preferred preset after flashing this build.

## Future Work

- Further waveform tuning if hardware feedback suggests it.
- Further envelope preset tuning and possible envelope editing mode.
- Optional flash persistence expansion for future complex envelope data.
- Release packaging with `info.yaml`, `.uf2`, and final docs.

## Design Notes

C1ZZL3 is intended as a playable, characterful program card rather than an exact Casio CZ clone. The code uses fixed-point integer arithmetic and lookup tables to stay inside the Workshop Computer's 48 kHz audio interrupt budget.

The current implementation favours hardware-tested musical behaviour over completeness. More complex UI layers, such as envelope editing, should be added in small testable steps so the validated v1 performance controls remain dependable.
